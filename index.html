  <h2>Welcome to the Future of Web3</h2>
  <p>
    The internet is evolving beyond platforms and middlemen. Web3 is about ownership, 
    transparency, and permissionless innovation. Instead of renting space on someone else’s 
    network, you hold the keys to your data, your identity, and your assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    With blockchain at the core, users aren’t just consumers, they’re stakeholders. 
    Communities drive growth, creators earn directly, and developers build 
    without gatekeepers. Every wallet is a passport, every transaction a proof of trust, 
    and every protocol an open playground.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it’s DeFi, NFTs, or DAOs, Web3 is breaking the mold of traditional systems. 
    The next decade won’t be owned by a handful of tech giants, it’ll be powered by 
    communities like yours. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn’t just the future of the internet. It’s the future of freedom.
